# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Your Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this Challenge will require the use of the `Inquirer` package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.

Because this application <span style="color:red">won’t be deployed</span>, you’ll need: 
1. Create a **walkthrough video** 
2. Demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. 
3. Submit a link to the video
4. Add it to the README of your project.

## Mock-Up

The following video shows an example of the application being used from the command line:
