# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Getting Started

This Challenge will require a video submission. Refer to the [Fullstack Blog Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for additional guidance on creating a video.

You’ll need to use the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line.

**Important**: You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. <span style="color:red;">Make sure that your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible on GitHub</span>. In upcoming lessons, you will learn how to better secure this password, or you can start researching npm packages now that could help you.

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a `.promise()` function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, refer to the [npm documentation on MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).

Design the database schema as shown in the following image:

As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

* `department`
    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`
    * `name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold department name

* `role`
    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`
    * `title`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold role title
    * `salary`: `DECIMAL` to hold role salary
    * `department_id`: `INT` to hold reference to department role belongs to

* `employee`
    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`
    * `first_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee first name
    * `last_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee last name
    * `role_id`: `INT` to hold reference to employee role
    * `manager_id`: `INT` to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (`null` if the employee has no manager)

You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a `seeds.sql` file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.
